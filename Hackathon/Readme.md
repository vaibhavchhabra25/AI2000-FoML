# Hackthon
These are my results for the hackathon conducted in the Foundations of Machine Learning course(3rd Sem).
The hackathon was conducted on Kaggle and the topic was "Is the driver at fault?". \\
The dataset has 42 features and almost all of them are categorical. Our aim was to train an ML algorithm that optimizes the evaluation metric i.e Accuracy.
