# Hackthon
* These are my results for the hackathon conducted in the Foundations of Machine Learning course(3rd Sem).
* The hackathon was conducted on Kaggle and the topic was "Is the driver at fault?".
* The dataset has 42 features and almost all of them are categorical.
* Our aim was to train an ML algorithm that optimizes the evaluation metric i.e Accuracy.
* Gradient Boosting Classifier performed best on the data and gave training acccuracy of 87% and validation accuracy of 84.2%, after a suitable tuning of parameters.
